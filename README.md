# urlshortner
This is a Crude, basic url shortening web application.
Using Jax-rs, jersey and few other basic plugins.

Some of the known issues in the code at this point is
1) The logic used to store the account & password and also the url and counters are simple static maps.
2) The host name, error/success messages are hardcoded and not internationlized.
3) Not a lot of the validations are added.
